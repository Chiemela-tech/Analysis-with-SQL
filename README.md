# Analysis-with-SQL
SQL is key in my journey as a data professional - data analysis, science and engineering.

### 1. Bicycle Sales Analysis 
This repository contains SQL codes for exploring a bicycle sales dataset. The scripts provide insights into various aspects of the sales data, including:

* Product availability: The stock levels of various bicycles across different stores are checked. 
* Sales trends: This shows the sales trends over time (monthly) to identify peak sales seasons.
* Top-selling products: It identifies the top-selling bicycles by quantity sold. 
* Customer segmentation: It analyzes the customer spending patterns  
* Staff performance: I evaluated the staff performance based on the number of orders handled and total sales generated. 
* Product details: I retrieved product details, including names, categories, list prices, quantities, and store locations for bicycles currently in stock. 

This is a basic overview of the functionalities within the scripts. Feel free to explore the scripts further to gain deeper insights into the sales data.
